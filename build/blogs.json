No clunky installations, no heavy servers handling all the streaming, just smooth, direct communication.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what this project delivers: a fully functional peer-to-peer (P2P) video calling and chat application, crafted from the ground up using modern web technologies. It\u2019s designed to be scalable, secure, and lightning-fast, bringing together real-time messaging, video/audio calls, and media sharing in one seamless platform.</p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll walk through the journey of building it\u200a\u2014\u200acovering the architecture, tech stack choices, tricky challenges, and the solutions that made it\u00a0work.</p>\n<h3>The Goal</h3>\n<p>When we started this project, our objective was to build a robust, secure, and real-time communication platform that could operate entirely within a browser without requiring any third-party installations. We wanted the application to be both technically efficient and user-friendly, making it suitable for everyday use while also serving as a practical demonstration of modern web communication technologies.</p>\n<p>Our goals\u00a0were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure Registration &amp; Login</strong><br>We aimed to implement a reliable authentication system that ensures only verified users can access communication features. This included encrypted password storage, JWT-based authentication, and protected routes to safeguard chat rooms and call sessions. Security and privacy were core principles from the beginning.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Real-Time Chat (Text + Images)</strong><br>We wanted a messaging system capable of instant message delivery with minimal latency, supporting both text-based communication and image sharing. To make image sharing smooth and fast, we planned to integrate a CDN-backed media service so that images load instantly regardless of user location.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Direct Peer-to-Peer Video &amp; Audio Calls (WebRTC)</strong><br>A key goal was to enable high-quality, low-latency video and audio calls using WebRTC. By establishing direct peer-to-peer connections, we could significantly reduce server bandwidth usage while providing a more responsive communication experience. This also aligns with best practices for secure, private media streaming.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Persistent Storage for Messages &amp; Media</strong><br>We wanted users to be able to revisit their conversations and media at any time, which meant storing messages in a database and hosting media files in a way that ensured both persistence and fast retrieval.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment for Public Access</strong><br>The final goal was to deploy the application to a publicly accessible platform, ensuring it could be used instantly by anyone with a web browser. This required a deployment approach that was reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Tech Stack &amp; Why We Chose\u00a0It</h3>\n<p>In designing our <strong>P2P Video Calling App</strong>, our goal was to select technologies that were <strong>modern, performant, developer-friendly, and well-supported by the community</strong>. At each stage, we considered multiple options and selected the stack that best balanced scalability, maintainability, and speed of development.</p>\n<h4>1. Frontend: React.js</h4>\n<p>React offered a <strong>component-based architecture</strong>, enabling us to break the UI into modular, reusable pieces. Its <strong>hooks</strong> system made managing state and side effects more intuitive, especially when integrating real-time features like WebRTC streams and Socket.io event listeners. The strong ecosystem of third-party libraries also accelerated our development.</p>\n<p><strong>Vue.js </strong>offers a gentle learning curve and great reactivity, but our team already had deeper experience with React, reducing onboarding time. <strong>Angular</strong> also is powerful and full-featured, but heavier and more complex than needed for our project\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p>We valued <strong>developer familiarity, a huge ecosystem, and flexibility</strong> over built-in complexity, making React the most efficient choice for rapid, high-quality development.</p>\n<h4>2. Backend: Node.js +\u00a0Express</h4>\n<p>Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, which is ideal for <strong>real-time applications</strong> where many users maintain persistent connections. Express, being minimalist, gave us just enough structure without locking us into a rigid framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Django (Python)</strong> is great for traditional web apps but more synchronous by nature, and web sockets would require additional packages like Channels. <strong>Spring Boot (Java)</strong> is very robust but heavier and more complex for a lightweight real-time system.</p>\n<p><strong>NodeJS + Express </strong>is a single-threaded event loop, which is a natural fit for WebSocket-heavy applications, and the existing Socket.io ecosystem integrates seamlessly with\u00a0it.</p>\n<h4>3. Real-Time Communication: Socket.io</h4>\n<p>Socket.io provides <strong>bi-directional, event-based communication</strong> over WebSockets, with built-in fallbacks for environments where WebSockets aren\u2019t supported. It\u2019s straightforward to use for <strong>both chat messaging and WebRTC signaling</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>WebSockets (native API)</strong> is more lightweight but lacks built-in reconnection logic, namespaces, and rooms management. <strong>SignalR (Microsoft)</strong> is very well-suited for\u00a0.NET environments but less natural in a Node.js ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We needed <strong>fast, reliable real-time communication with minimal boilerplate</strong>, and Socket.io gave us robust features like auto-reconnect and room broadcasting right out of the\u00a0box.</p>\n<h4>4. Video/Audio Streaming: WebRTC</h4>\n<p>WebRTC enables <strong>secure, peer-to-peer streaming</strong> of audio, video, and data, bypassing the server for actual media transfer. This dramatically <strong>reduces server bandwidth costs and improves\u00a0latency</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>MediaSoup</strong> is a great SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for group calls, but overkill for our initial P2P target. <strong>Janus Gateway </strong>is feature-rich but adds deployment complexity for a project focused on browser-native P2P.</p>\n<p><strong>WebRTC </strong>is<strong> </strong>built into modern browsers, eliminating the need for plugins and external media servers in a two-party setup.</p>\n<h4>5. Database: MongoDB</h4>\n<p>MongoDB\u2019s <strong>flexible, schema-less design</strong> was perfect for storing chat messages, user profiles, and media metadata, which don\u2019t always follow a strict relational structure. It scales horizontally and integrates well with Node.js through Mongoose.</p>\n<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> has strong relational features and ACID compliance, but less suited for unstructured chat data. <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> is excellent for real-time sync, but vendor lock-in and pricing concerns influenced our decision.</p>\n<p>We wanted <strong>speed, flexibility, and easy integration</strong> with JavaScript, which MongoDB offers naturally.</p>\n<h4>6. Image Hosting: ImageKit\u00a0API</h4>\n<p>ImageKit provided <strong>fast, global CDN delivery</strong> for images, along with easy upload handling and automatic optimizations. This offloaded heavy image storage and processing from our\u00a0backend.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudinary</strong> is similar in features but came with slightly more complex pricing tiers. <strong>AWS S3 + CloudFront</strong> is very powerful but required more setup and lacked built-in image optimization without extra services.</p>\n<p>We prioritized <strong>developer speed, minimal setup, and built-in optimizations</strong>, and ImageKit checked all those\u00a0boxes.</p>\n<h4>7. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web\u00a0Tokens)</h4>\n<p>JWTs are <strong>stateless</strong> and ideal for distributed systems. Once issued, a token can be verified without querying the database, making authentication faster and more scalable.</p>\n<p><strong>Session-based Auth</strong> is simpler for small projects but requires server-side session storage, which doesn\u2019t scale well horizontally. <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> is powerful for third-party logins but unnecessary for our initial internal user\u00a0system.</p>\n<p>We needed <strong>scalable, stateless, secure authentication</strong>, and JWTs fit perfectly with our architecture.</p>\n<h4>8. Deployment: Render</h4>\n<p>Render provided a <strong>simple, unified platform</strong> to deploy both frontend and backend with SSL, CI/CD, and environment variable management included.</p>\n<p><strong>Heroku</strong> is developer-friendly but with higher costs for scaling and some limitations on WebSocket timeouts. <strong>AWS EC2</strong> is highly customizable but more setup work for networking, scaling, and security.</p>\n<p>We valued <strong>ease of deployment and integrated scaling features</strong> over the granular control offered by more complex cloud platforms, hence proceeding with\u00a0Render.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-Step Implementation</h3>\n<h4>1. User Authentication &amp; Protected Routes</h4>\n<p>For authentication, we implemented <strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</strong> to ensure a secure, stateless, and scalable login system. The backend is responsible for verifying credentials, generating a token, and protecting private\u00a0routes.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend login route (Node.js):</strong></p>\n<pre>app.post(\"/login\", async (req, res) =&gt; {<br>const user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });<br>if (!user) return res.status(400).send(\"User not found\");<br>const validPass = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);<br>if (!validPass) return res.status(400).send(\"Invalid password\");<br>const token = jwt.sign(<br>{ _id: user._id },<br>process.env.JWT_SECRET,<br>{ expiresIn: \"1h\" }<br>);<br>res.json({ token });<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use <strong>bcrypt</strong> to securely hash and compare passwords.</li>\n<li>On successful login, we generate a <strong>JWT</strong> with an expiration time of 1\u00a0hour.</li>\n<li>The token is then sent to the frontend for subsequent authenticated requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Protected route middleware:</strong></p>\n<pre>function verifyToken(req, res, next) {<br>  const token = req.header(\"auth-token\");<br>  if (!token) return res.status(401).send(\"Access Denied\");<br>  try {<br>    req.user = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);<br>    next();<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    res.status(400).send(\"Invalid Token\");<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This middleware intercepts incoming requests to protected routes.</li>\n<li>If no token is found or it\u2019s invalid, access is\u00a0denied.</li>\n<li>Valid tokens allow the request to\u00a0proceed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Real-Time Chat with Text &amp;\u00a0Images</h4>\n<p>For real-time messaging, we used <strong>Socket.io</strong> for fast, bidirectional communication and <strong>MongoDB</strong> to store messages persistently. Image uploads are handled by <strong>ImageKit</strong> for CDN delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Socket.io chat handling:</strong></p>\n<pre>io.on(\"connection\", (socket) =&gt; {<br>  socket.on(\"sendMessage\", async ({ roomId, message, sender }) =&gt; {<br>    const chatMessage = new Chat({ roomId, message, sender });<br>    await chatMessage.save();<br>    io.to(roomId).emit(\"newMessage\", chatMessage);<br>  });<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every message is stored in MongoDB before being broadcast to all clients in the same chat\u00a0room.</li>\n<li>This ensures chat history is preserved and retrievable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Image upload with ImageKit:</strong></p>\n<pre>const imagekit = new ImageKit({<br>  publicKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC,<br>  privateKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE,<br>  urlEndpoint: process.env.IMAGEKIT_URL<br>  });<br>app.post(\"/upload\", (req, res) =&gt; {<br>imagekit.upload({<br>  file: req.files.image.data.toString(\"base64\"),<br>  fileName: req.files.image.name<br>  }).then(result =&gt; res.json(result))<br>  .catch(err =&gt; res.status(500).json(err));<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The uploaded image is converted to Base64 and sent to ImageKit.</li>\n<li>ImageKit stores it and returns a <strong>CDN URL</strong> for instant retrieval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Peer-to-Peer Video Calling with\u00a0WebRTC</h4>\n<p>Video/audio calls are handled <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> via WebRTC, while Socket.io is used only for <strong>signaling</strong> (exchanging offer/answer and ICE candidates).</p>\n<p><strong>Frontend WebRTC\u00a0setup:</strong></p>\n<pre>const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();<br>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })<br>.then(stream =&gt; {<br>  localVideo.srcObject = stream;<br>  stream.getTracks().forEach(track =&gt; peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream));<br>});<br>peerConnection.ontrack = event =&gt; {<br>  remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0];<br>};</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>getUserMedia()</strong> fetches the local camera and microphone streams.</li>\n<li>The tracks are added to the <strong>RTCPeerConnection</strong> for transmission.</li>\n<li>The ontrack event updates the remote video element with the incoming\u00a0stream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Signaling with Socket.io:</strong></p>\n<pre>socket.on(\"offer\", async (offer) =&gt; {<br>  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));<br>  const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();<br>  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);<br>  socket.emit(\"answer\", answer);<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a peer sends an <strong>offer</strong>, we set it as the remote description.</li>\n<li>We then create an <strong>answer</strong>, set it as our local description, and send it back via Socket.io.</li>\n<li>This allows the peers to establish a direct media connection without passing the actual video/audio through the\u00a0server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Profile Page\u200a\u2014\u200aPersonalizing the Experience</h4>\n<p>To create a more user-centric feel, we implemented a <strong>Profile Page</strong> where each logged-in user can view their account details, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Profile picture (hosted on <strong>ImageKit</strong>)</li>\n<li>Date of registration</li>\n<li>Optional status\u00a0message</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>data flow</strong> is straightforward but\u00a0secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The frontend (React) sends a request to the backend API endpoint <strong>/me</strong>, attaching the <strong>JWT token</strong> in the request\u00a0headers.</li>\n<li>The backend middleware verifies the token before retrieving the user document from\u00a0<strong>MongoDB</strong>.</li>\n<li>The server responds with the user\u2019s details, which are then displayed in the React component.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Backend API Endpoint:</strong></p>\n<pre>app.get(\"/me\", verifyToken, async (req, res) =&gt; {<br>  try {<br>    const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select(\"-password\"); // Exclude password<br>    if (!user) return res.status(404).send(\"User not found\");<br>    res.json(user);<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    res.status(500).json({ error: \"Server error\" });<br>  }<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Frontend Fetch Example\u00a0(React):</strong></p>\n<pre>useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>  fetch(\"/me\", {<br>    headers: { \"auth-token\": localStorage.getItem(\"token\") }<br>  })<br>  .then(res =&gt; res.json())<br>  .then(data =&gt; setProfile(data))<br>  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));<br>}, []);</pre>\n<h4>5. Deployment\u200a\u2014\u200aMaking It\u00a0Public</h4>\n<p>To ensure the app is accessible for anyone to test and use, we deployed both the <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> using\u00a0<strong>Render</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Deployment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Stack:</strong> Node.js + Express + Socket.io</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Features:</strong> Real-time chat, WebRTC signaling, authentication APIs, file uploads to ImageKit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Render?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple GitHub integration for\u00a0CI/CD.</li>\n<li>Free tier supports hobby projects.</li>\n<li>HTTPS provided automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pushed backend code to\u00a0GitHub.</li>\n<li>Linked Render to the repository.</li>\n<li>Set environment variables for JWT secret, MongoDB URI, and ImageKit\u00a0keys.</li>\n<li>Selected <strong>Node environment</strong> with npm install &amp;&amp; npm start build commands.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Frontend Deployment:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Stack:</strong> React.js static\u00a0build</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Why Render over Netlify/Vercel?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier to manage both frontend and backend in the same platform.</li>\n<li>Automatic CDN for static\u00a0assets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ran npm run build locally or via Render\u2019s build pipeline.</li>\n<li>Uploaded the static build directory to Render\u2019s static site\u00a0hosting.</li>\n<li>Configured environment variables for API endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once deployed, we had <strong>two public\u00a0URLs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Backend API &amp; Socket server URL: <a href=\"https://app-backend.onrender.com/\">https://app-backend.onrender.com</a>\n</li>\n<li>Frontend React app URL: <a href=\"https://app-frontend.onrender.com/\">https://app-frontend.onrender.com</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why This Approach Works\u00a0Well</h3>\n<p>We carefully chose this architecture and tech stack to balance performance, scalability, cost, and user experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalable:</strong> With Node.js and Socket.io running on an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, the backend can handle a high number of concurrent users without slowing down. This makes it ideal for real-time interactions like chat and\u00a0calls.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost-efficient:</strong> WebRTC enables peer-to-peer streaming, meaning the server is not burdened with relaying heavy video/audio streams. This keeps hosting costs low and improves\u00a0latency.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User-friendly:</strong> React ensures the frontend is clean, responsive, and works seamlessly across devices, making the application easy to navigate and pleasant to\u00a0use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure:</strong> Using JWT for authentication ensures that only authorized users can access chats and calls, protecting both data and media\u00a0streams.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fast media delivery:</strong> ImageKit\u2019s CDN accelerates image loading and optimizes file sizes, ensuring smooth sharing of images even on slower networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Challenges We Encountered</h3>\n<p>Every feature came with its own set of hurdles, which we tackled one by\u00a0one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>WebRTC Signaling Logic:</strong> Coordinating the offer/answer exchange and managing ICE candidates was a learning curve, as it involved multiple asynchronous events happening in quick succession.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Network Conditions:</strong> While P2P is efficient, it relies heavily on successful NAT traversal. We tested across different networks to identify situations where STUN/TURN servers might be necessary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Syncing Chat State:</strong> We ensured that chat history remains consistent, even if a user disconnects and reconnects, by fetching missed messages from MongoDB on reconnection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>This project gave us deep, practical insights into building real-time communication platforms\u200a\u2014\u200afar beyond what theory or tutorials could provide. We now have a <strong>fully functional P2P video calling + chat application</strong> that is production-ready and easy to\u00a0extend.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to explore the code base or try the app yourself, you can find the full source code\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/SankalpBahad/P2P-Video-Calling-App\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://x.com/SankalpBahad\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-bahad-8b52822a6\">LinkedIn</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/SankalpBahad\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=00cb59b424c9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<p>Imagine opening a browser tab and instantly being able to connect with someone\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it\u2019s through a quick text exchange, sharing an image, or jumping straight into a live video call.

Deployment: Render</h4>\n<p>Render provided a <strong>simple, unified platform</strong> to deploy both frontend and backend with SSL, CI/CD, and environment variable management included.</p>\n<p><strong>Heroku</strong> is developer-friendly but with higher costs for scaling and some limitations on WebSocket timeouts. <strong>AWS EC2</strong> is highly customizable but more setup work for networking, scaling, and security.</p>\n<p>We valued <strong>ease of deployment and integrated scaling features</strong> over the granular control offered by more complex cloud platforms, hence proceeding with\u00a0Render.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-Step Implementation</h3>\n<h4>1. User Authentication &amp; Protected Routes</h4>\n<p>For authentication, we implemented <strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</strong> to ensure a secure, stateless, and scalable login system. The backend is responsible for verifying credentials, generating a token, and protecting private\u00a0routes.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend login route (Node.js):</strong></p>\n<pre>app.post(\"/login\", async (req, res) =&gt; {<br>const user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });<br>if (!user) return res.status(400).send(\"User not found\");<br>const validPass = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);<br>if (!validPass) return res.status(400).send(\"Invalid password\");<br>const token = jwt.sign(<br>{ _id: user._id },<br>process.env.JWT_SECRET,<br>{ expiresIn: \"1h\" }<br>);<br>res.json({ token });<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use <strong>bcrypt</strong> to securely hash and compare passwords.</li>\n<li>On successful login, we generate a <strong>JWT</strong> with an expiration time of 1\u00a0hour.</li>\n<li>The token is then sent to the frontend for subsequent authenticated requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Protected route middleware:</strong></p>\n<pre>function verifyToken(req, res, next) {<br>  const token = req.header(\"auth-token\");<br>  if (!token) return res.status(401).send(\"Access Denied\");<br>  try {<br>    req.user = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);<br>    next();<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    res.status(400).send(\"Invalid Token\");<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This middleware intercepts incoming requests to protected routes.</li>\n<li>If no token is found or it\u2019s invalid, access is\u00a0denied.</li>\n<li>Valid tokens allow the request to\u00a0proceed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Real-Time Chat with Text &amp;\u00a0Images</h4>\n<p>For real-time messaging, we used <strong>Socket.io</strong> for fast, bidirectional communication and <strong>MongoDB</strong> to store messages persistently. Image uploads are handled by <strong>ImageKit</strong> for CDN delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Socket.io chat handling:</strong></p>\n<pre>io.on(\"connection\", (socket) =&gt; {<br>  socket.on(\"sendMessage\", async ({ roomId, message, sender }) =&gt; {<br>    const chatMessage = new Chat({ roomId, message, sender });<br>    await chatMessage.save();<br>    io.to(roomId).emit(\"newMessage\", chatMessage);<br>  });<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every message is stored in MongoDB before being broadcast to all clients in the same chat\u00a0room.</li>\n<li>This ensures chat history is preserved and retrievable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Image upload with ImageKit:</strong></p>\n<pre>const imagekit = new ImageKit({<br>  publicKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC,<br>  privateKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE,<br>  urlEndpoint: process.env.IMAGEKIT_URL<br>  });<br>app.post(\"/upload\", (req, res) =&gt; {<br>imagekit.upload({<br>  file: req.files.image.data.toString(\"base64\"),<br>  fileName: req.files.image.name<br>  }).then(result =&gt; res.json(result))<br>  .catch(err =&gt; res.status(500).json(err));<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The uploaded image is converted to Base64 and sent to ImageKit.</li>\n<li>ImageKit stores it and returns a <strong>CDN URL</strong> for instant retrieval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Peer-to-Peer Video Calling with\u00a0WebRTC</h4>\n<p>Video/audio calls are handled <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> via WebRTC, while Socket.io is used only for <strong>signaling</strong> (exchanging offer/answer and ICE candidates).</p>\n<p><strong>Frontend WebRTC\u00a0setup:</strong></p>\n<pre>const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();<br>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })<br>.then(stream =&gt; {<br>  localVideo.srcObject = stream;<br>  stream.getTracks().forEach(track =&gt; peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream));<br>});<br>peerConnection.ontrack = event =&gt; {<br>  remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0];<br>};</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>getUserMedia()</strong> fetches the local camera and microphone streams.</li>\n<li>The tracks are added to the <strong>RTCPeerConnection</strong> for transmission.</li>\n<li>The ontrack event updates the remote video element with the incoming\u00a0stream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Signaling with Socket.io:</strong></p>\n<pre>socket.on(\"offer\", async (offer) =&gt; {<br>  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));<br>  const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();<br>  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);<br>  socket.emit(\"answer\", answer);<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a peer sends an <strong>offer</strong>, we set it as the remote description.</li>\n<li>We then create an <strong>answer</strong>, set it as our local description, and send it back via Socket.io.</li>\n<li>This allows the peers to establish a direct media connection without passing the actual video/audio through the\u00a0server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Profile Page\u200a\u2014\u200aPersonalizing the Experience</h4>\n<p>To create a more user-centric feel, we implemented a <strong>Profile Page</strong> where each logged-in user can view their account details, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Profile picture (hosted on <strong>ImageKit</strong>)</li>\n<li>Date of registration</li>\n<li>Optional status\u00a0message</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>data flow</strong> is straightforward but\u00a0secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The frontend (React) sends a request to the backend API endpoint <strong>/me</strong>, attaching the <strong>JWT token</strong> in the request\u00a0headers.</li>\n<li>The backend middleware verifies the token before retrieving the user document from\u00a0<strong>MongoDB</strong>.</li>\n<li>The server responds with the user\u2019s details, which are then displayed in the React component.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Backend API Endpoint:</strong></p>\n<pre>app.get(\"/me\", verifyToken, async (req, res) =&gt; {<br>  try {<br>    const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select(\"-password\"); // Exclude password<br>    if (!user) return res.status(404).send(\"User not found\");<br>    res.json(user);<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    res.status(500).json({ error: \"Server error\" });<br>  }<br>});</pre>\n<p><strong>Frontend Fetch Example\u00a0(React):</strong></p>\n<pre>useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>  fetch(\"/me\", {<br>    headers: { \"auth-token\": localStorage.getItem(\"token\") }<br>  })<br>  .then(res =&gt; res.json())<br>  .then(data =&gt; setProfile(data))<br>  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));<br>}, []);</pre>\n<h4>5. Deployment\u200a\u2014\u200aMaking It\u00a0Public</h4>\n<p>To ensure the app is accessible for anyone to test and use, we deployed both the <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> using\u00a0<strong>Render</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Deployment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Stack:</strong> Node.js + Express + Socket.io</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Features:</strong> Real-time chat, WebRTC signaling, authentication APIs, file uploads to ImageKit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Render?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple GitHub integration for\u00a0CI/CD.</li>\n<li>Free tier supports hobby projects.</li>\n<li>HTTPS provided automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pushed backend code to\u00a0GitHub.</li>\n<li>Linked Render to the repository.</li>\n<li>Set environment variables for JWT secret, MongoDB URI, and ImageKit\u00a0keys.</li>\n<li>Selected <strong>Node environment</strong> with npm install &amp;&amp; npm start build commands.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Frontend Deployment:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Stack:</strong> React.js static\u00a0build</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Why Render over Netlify/Vercel?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier to manage both frontend and backend in the same platform.</li>\n<li>Automatic CDN for static\u00a0assets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ran npm run build locally or via Render\u2019s build pipeline.</li>\n<li>Uploaded the static build directory to Render\u2019s static site\u00a0hosting.</li>\n<li>Configured environment variables for API endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once deployed, we had <strong>two public\u00a0URLs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Backend API &amp; Socket server URL: <a href=\"https://app-backend.onrender.com/\">https://app-backend.onrender.com</a>\n</li>\n<li>Frontend React app URL: <a href=\"https://app-frontend.onrender.com/\">https://app-frontend.onrender.com</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why This Approach Works\u00a0Well</h3>\n<p>We carefully chose this architecture and tech stack to balance performance, scalability, cost, and user experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalable:</strong> With Node.js and Socket.io running on an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, the backend can handle a high number of concurrent users without slowing down. This makes it ideal for real-time interactions like chat and\u00a0calls.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost-efficient:</strong> WebRTC enables peer-to-peer streaming, meaning the server is not burdened with relaying heavy video/audio streams. This keeps hosting costs low and improves\u00a0latency.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User-friendly:</strong> React ensures the frontend is clean, responsive, and works seamlessly across devices, making the application easy to navigate and pleasant to\u00a0use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure:</strong> Using JWT for authentication ensures that only authorized users can access chats and calls, protecting both data and media\u00a0streams.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fast media delivery:</strong> ImageKit\u2019s CDN accelerates image loading and optimizes file sizes, ensuring smooth sharing of images even on slower networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Challenges We Encountered</h3>\n<p>Every feature came with its own set of hurdles, which we tackled one by\u00a0one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>WebRTC Signaling Logic:</strong> Coordinating the offer/answer exchange and managing ICE candidates was a learning curve, as it involved multiple asynchronous events happening in quick succession.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Network Conditions:</strong> While P2P is efficient, it relies heavily on successful NAT traversal. We tested across different networks to identify situations where STUN/TURN servers might be necessary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Syncing Chat State:</strong> We ensured that chat history remains consistent, even if a user disconnects and reconnects, by fetching missed messages from MongoDB on reconnection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>This project gave us deep, practical insights into building real-time communication platforms\u200a\u2014\u200afar beyond what theory or tutorials could provide. We now have a <strong>fully functional P2P video calling + chat application</strong> that is production-ready and easy to\u00a0extend.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to explore the code base or try the app yourself, you can find the full source code\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/SankalpBahad/P2P-Video-Calling-App\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://x.com/SankalpBahad\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-bahad-8b52822a6\">LinkedIn</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/SankalpBahad\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=00cb59b424c9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["imagekit","webrtc","socketio","mongodb","mern-stack"]},{"title":"Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1: The Frontier of Open Source AI?","pubDate":"2024-07-25 19:04:37","link":"https://medium.com/@sankalpsbahad/metas-llama-3-1-the-frontier-of-open-source-ai-c6887a5b6740?source=rss-a4535ee6b887------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/c6887a5b6740","author":"Sankalp Bahad","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/0*I-q10SK3VwjjUqhi\"></figure><p>Meta has made a significant stride in the AI landscape with the release of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI model set to redefine industry standards.

This blog provides an overview of the main categories of machine learning, their characteristics, and some common techniques used in the field. Whether you\u2019re new to ML or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will help you understand the fundamental concepts and approaches used in modern machine learning.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/875/0*caDvuPoPq4H-owGp.png\"></figure><h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>A typical machine learning task involves prediction or inference based on the problem encountered, the question asked, and the available data. Machine learning tasks mostly rely on patterns in the data rather than being programmed explicitly. Choosing which broad ML category fits your situation, followed by appropriate measures for tackling the problem, is crucial. Selecting the best algorithm for your scenario is important in solving machine learning problems.</p>\n<h3>Major Categories of Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Machine learning can be divided into four major categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Supervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Unsupervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Semi-supervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Reinforcement learning</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Supervised Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Supervised machine learning involves \u201csupervision,\u201d where the model is shown input and corresponding output, then asked to learn patterns and predict outcomes for unseen input. Models are trained on labelled datasets. The main aim is to make the model learn how to map input variables to output variables. Classification and Regression are two main types of problems in supervised learning.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides an exact idea about object classes since it works with the labelled\u00a0data.</li>\n<li>Helps predict future outcomes solely based on prior experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Not very helpful for highly complex\u00a0tasks.</li>\n<li>May require extensive knowledge, a longer training time and a large amount of data to achieve exceptional results.</li>\n<li>Might not give the best results if tested on a different domain than the training data\u00a0domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unsupervised Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Unsupervised machine learning does not require labelled data. The machine learns patterns from unlabelled data and predicts output. The main aim is to group or categorize unsorted data based on similarities, differences, and patterns. Clustering and Dimensionality reduction are fundamental problems in unsupervised learning.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Useful for complicated tasks as the algorithm works on unlabelled data.</li>\n<li>Works well in real-world scenarios with scarcity of high-quality data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics might not be very accurate due to unlabelled data.</li>\n<li>Presents its own set of complex challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Semi-supervised Learning</h3>\n<p>Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labelled and unlabelled data during training. It leans towards unsupervised learning, leveraging mostly unlabelled data due to the high cost of labelling. This concept was mainly introduced to handle the shortcomings of supervised and unsupervised learning. The main aim is to efficiently use all available data and cluster similar types of data along with an unsupervised algorithm, helping to label unlabelled data.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and easy to understand and highly efficient.</li>\n<li>Solves some drawbacks of supervised and unsupervised learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>May not work in certain\u00a0cases.</li>\n<li>Accuracy might be affected due to labelled and unlabelled data presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>\n<p>Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based mechanism. An agent explores its surroundings by trial and error, learning from experience and outcomes to improve performance. A reward mechanism enhances the learning process, intending to maximize rewards. There is no labelled data; learning is purely based on experiences.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Helps solve complex real-world problems where general techniques fail.</li>\n<li>Produces accurate results due to similarity to human learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cannot be easily applied to simpler problems.</li>\n<li>Requires large amounts of data for training.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Decision Trees</h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin our exploration of classification and regression models by examining one of the most popular methods: decision trees. Decision trees are a versatile supervised learning technique that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, although they are particularly favoured for classification problems.</p>\n<h4>Structure of a Decision\u00a0Tree</h4>\n<p>A decision tree can be visualized as a tree-like structure with the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Internal nodes</strong>: Represent the dataset\u00a0features</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Branches</strong>: Represent decision\u00a0rules</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaves</strong>: Represent outcomes or final classifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The internal nodes, also known as decision nodes, are used to make decisions for an input variable and typically have multiple branches.</p>\n<h4>Decision Tree\u00a0Flow</h4>\n<p>The process of classification using a decision tree can be understood as\u00a0follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A variable with multiple features enters the root\u00a0node.</li>\n<li>The root node examines a relevant feature and asks a question.</li>\n<li>Based on the answer, the variable is directed to one of the branches.</li>\n<li>The branch connects the root node to another decision node, which is concerned with a different feature.</li>\n<li>This process of asking questions and directing the variable continues until a node with no more child branches is reached (a leaf\u00a0node).</li>\n<li>The leaf node is associated with a specific category, completing the classification process for that variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: This explanation can be particularly useful when trying to describe decision trees to someone unfamiliar with the concept, such as a young learner or someone new to machine learning.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Advantages of Decision\u00a0Trees</h4>\n<p>Decision trees offer several benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They closely mimic human decision-making processes.</li>\n<li>They provide a clear visual representation of the decision-making process.</li>\n<li>The reasoning behind a particular classification can be easily understood through visualization.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Generating a Decision\u00a0Tree</h4>\n<p>The process of generating a decision tree involves the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the best attribute of the dataset using a selection metric.</li>\n<li>Divide the dataset into subsets based on the possible values of the chosen attribute.</li>\n<li>Generate the tree recursively based on the values and attributes of the\u00a0subsets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Attribute Selection Measures</h4>\n<p>To select the best attributes for splitting the data, several metrics can be used. Two popular methods\u00a0are:</p>\n<h4>1. Information Gain</h4>\n<p>Information gain calculates how much the randomness of selection changes after segmenting the dataset for each attribute. It quantifies the amount of information an attribute provides about the class. The attribute with the maximum information gain is chosen for the\u00a0split.</p>\n<h4>2. Gini\u00a0Index</h4>\n<p>The Gini index is a measure of impurity or purity when creating a decision tree. A lower Gini index indicates a higher preference for the attribute.

This blog provides an overview of the main categories of machine learning, their characteristics, and some common techniques used in the field. Whether you\u2019re new to ML or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will help you understand the fundamental concepts and approaches used in modern machine learning.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/875/0*caDvuPoPq4H-owGp.png\"></figure><h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>A typical machine learning task involves prediction or inference based on the problem encountered, the question asked, and the available data. Machine learning tasks mostly rely on patterns in the data rather than being programmed explicitly. Choosing which broad ML category fits your situation, followed by appropriate measures for tackling the problem, is crucial. Selecting the best algorithm for your scenario is important in solving machine learning problems.</p>\n<h3>Major Categories of Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Machine learning can be divided into four major categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Supervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Unsupervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Semi-supervised machine\u00a0learning</li>\n<li>Reinforcement learning</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Supervised Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Supervised machine learning involves \u201csupervision,\u201d where the model is shown input and corresponding output, then asked to learn patterns and predict outcomes for unseen input. Models are trained on labelled datasets. The main aim is to make the model learn how to map input variables to output variables. Classification and Regression are two main types of problems in supervised learning.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides an exact idea about object classes since it works with the labelled\u00a0data.</li>\n<li>Helps predict future outcomes solely based on prior experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Not very helpful for highly complex\u00a0tasks.</li>\n<li>May require extensive knowledge, a longer training time and a large amount of data to achieve exceptional results.</li>\n<li>Might not give the best results if tested on a different domain than the training data\u00a0domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unsupervised Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Unsupervised machine learning does not require labelled data. The machine learns patterns from unlabelled data and predicts output. The main aim is to group or categorize unsorted data based on similarities, differences, and patterns. Clustering and Dimensionality reduction are fundamental problems in unsupervised learning.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Useful for complicated tasks as the algorithm works on unlabelled data.</li>\n<li>Works well in real-world scenarios with scarcity of high-quality data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics might not be very accurate due to unlabelled data.</li>\n<li>Presents its own set of complex challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Semi-supervised Learning</h3>\n<p>Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labelled and unlabelled data during training. It leans towards unsupervised learning, leveraging mostly unlabelled data due to the high cost of labelling. This concept was mainly introduced to handle the shortcomings of supervised and unsupervised learning. The main aim is to efficiently use all available data and cluster similar types of data along with an unsupervised algorithm, helping to label unlabelled data.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and easy to understand and highly efficient.</li>\n<li>Solves some drawbacks of supervised and unsupervised learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>May not work in certain\u00a0cases.</li>\n<li>Accuracy might be affected due to labelled and unlabelled data presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>\n<p>Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based mechanism. An agent explores its surroundings by trial and error, learning from experience and outcomes to improve performance. A reward mechanism enhances the learning process, intending to maximize rewards. There is no labelled data; learning is purely based on experiences.</p>\n<h4>Advantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Helps solve complex real-world problems where general techniques fail.</li>\n<li>Produces accurate results due to similarity to human learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cannot be easily applied to simpler problems.</li>\n<li>Requires large amounts of data for training.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Decision Trees</h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin our exploration of classification and regression models by examining one of the most popular methods: decision trees. Decision trees are a versatile supervised learning technique that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, although they are particularly favoured for classification problems.</p>\n<h4>Structure of a Decision\u00a0Tree</h4>\n<p>A decision tree can be visualized as a tree-like structure with the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Internal nodes</strong>: Represent the dataset\u00a0features</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Branches</strong>: Represent decision\u00a0rules</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaves</strong>: Represent outcomes or final classifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The internal nodes, also known as decision nodes, are used to make decisions for an input variable and typically have multiple branches.</p>\n<h4>Decision Tree\u00a0Flow</h4>\n<p>The process of classification using a decision tree can be understood as\u00a0follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A variable with multiple features enters the root\u00a0node.</li>\n<li>The root node examines a relevant feature and asks a question.</li>\n<li>Based on the answer, the variable is directed to one of the branches.</li>\n<li>The branch connects the root node to another decision node, which is concerned with a different feature.</li>\n<li>This process of asking questions and directing the variable continues until a node with no more child branches is reached (a leaf\u00a0node).</li>\n<li>The leaf node is associated with a specific category, completing the classification process for that variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: This explanation can be particularly useful when trying to describe decision trees to someone unfamiliar with the concept, such as a young learner or someone new to machine learning.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Advantages of Decision\u00a0Trees</h4>\n<p>Decision trees offer several benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They closely mimic human decision-making processes.</li>\n<li>They provide a clear visual representation of the decision-making process.</li>\n<li>The reasoning behind a particular classification can be easily understood through visualization.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Generating a Decision\u00a0Tree</h4>\n<p>The process of generating a decision tree involves the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the best attribute of the dataset using a selection metric.</li>\n<li>Divide the dataset into subsets based on the possible values of the chosen attribute.</li>\n<li>Generate the tree recursively based on the values and attributes of the\u00a0subsets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Attribute Selection Measures</h4>\n<p>To select the best attributes for splitting the data, several metrics can be used. Two popular methods\u00a0are:</p>\n<h4>1. Information Gain</h4>\n<p>Information gain calculates how much the randomness of selection changes after segmenting the dataset for each attribute. It quantifies the amount of information an attribute provides about the class. The attribute with the maximum information gain is chosen for the\u00a0split.</p>\n<h4>2. Gini\u00a0Index</h4>\n<p>The Gini index is a measure of impurity or purity when creating a decision tree. A lower Gini index indicates a higher preference for the attribute. The Gini index is particularly useful for creating binary splits in the\u00a0tree.</p>\n<h4>Pruning</h4>\n<p>Pruning is an essential step in optimizing decision trees. It involves removing unnecessary nodes from the tree to achieve an optimal balance of breadth and depth while ensuring all relevant information is retained with minimal computation. The main goals of pruning\u00a0are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduce overfitting</li>\n<li>Improve generalization</li>\n<li>Enhance the tree\u2019s performance on unseen\u00a0data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are two main approaches to\u00a0pruning:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Pre-pruning</strong>: Also known as early stopping, this method involves setting stopping criteria during the tree-building process to prevent the tree from growing too\u00a0large.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Post-pruning</strong>: This technique involves building the full tree and then removing nodes that do not provide significant information gain or predictive power.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Limitations of Decision\u00a0Trees</h4>\n<p>While decision trees are powerful and intuitive, they do have some limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They can be prone to overfitting, especially with deep\u00a0trees.</li>\n<li>They may not perform well on imbalanced datasets.</li>\n<li>Small changes in the data can sometimes lead to large changes in the tree structure.</li>\n<li>They may struggle with capturing complex relationships in the\u00a0data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Despite these limitations, decision trees remain a fundamental and widely used technique in machine learning, often serving as a building block for more advanced ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Machine learning is a diverse field with various approaches to solving complex problems.

Whether you\u2019re a curious novice or a budding data scientist, join us on this journey as we explore the building blocks of artificial intelligence, starting with the cornerstone of it all: <strong>data analysis</strong>. Buckle up, because we\u2019re about to embark on an adventure that will transform the way you see the world\u200a\u2014\u200aand the machines that are learning to see it with\u00a0us.</p>\n<h3>1. The Significance of Data Analysis in Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Data analysis is an essential step in the machine learning process. It involves thoroughly examining datasets to gain valuable insights that inform modelling decisions and help avoid potential pitfalls. This process is critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of machine learning models. Raw data might introduce some errors and inaccuracies in the model, which can be a big risk in the long term. To avoid such scenarios data analysis and pre-processing come into the picture. We now look at the types of data analysis.</p>\n<h3>2. Types of Data\u00a0Analysis</h3>\n<h4>2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis\u00a0(EDA)</h4>\n<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the cornerstone of any machine learning project, serving as the critical first step in understanding and preparing your data. This process primarily utilizes the pandas library in Python, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.</p>\n<p>Exploratory data analysis broadly involves the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extracting various features from the dataset based on the use case and filtering out the relevant and irrelevant information in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>Identifying the number of occurrences of certain elements in columns to help understand the dominant categories of our\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>Understanding key characteristics, patterns, and relationships between different variables to uncover correlations between variables.</li>\n<li>Cleaning the data by removing the irrelevant information and imputing the data to not have any gaps, to make it ready for\u00a0use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main objectives of EDA\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaining a good understanding of the data\u2019s nature and structure, and some valuable insights into the distribution and range of typical variables.</li>\n<li>Cleaning the data by filling empty cells, dropping irrelevant columns, and obtaining statistical values.</li>\n<li>Performing a quality check, data integrity and consistency before any sort of modelling is performed on\u00a0it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This step of exploratory data analysis provides a solid foundation for model development by ensuring that you\u2019re working with clean, relevant, and well-understood data and setting up the stage for successful model development.</p>\n<h4>2.2 Visual Data\u00a0Analysis</h4>\n<p>Visual Data Analysis is a powerful complement to EDA, offering intuitive and accessible ways to understand complex datasets.

Types of\u00a0Features</h3>\n<p>It is essential to comprehend the various feature types present in our dataset for thorough analysis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Quantitative features</strong>: These consist of ordered numbers, which can be discrete (such as integers) or continuous (such as real numbers). They are utilised to quantify elements by expressing count or measurement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Categorical features</strong>: These encompass a fixed set of values, with each value assigning an observation to a specific category or group, reflecting qualitative characteristics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Binary features</strong>: This represents a special case of categorical features with only two categories.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ordinal features</strong>: These are another instance of categorical features in which the values are\u00a0ordered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Types of Visualisation</h3>\n<h4>4.1 Single Feature Visualisation (Univariate Visualization)</h4>\n<p>Univariate visualization focuses on examining one feature at a time, providing insights into the distribution and characteristics of individual variables. This approach is crucial for understanding the basic structure of your data before exploring relationships between variables.</p>\n<p>We now look at how univariate visualisation can be performed on the types of features we looked at earlier, one by\u00a0one.</p>\n<h4><strong>For Quantitative Features:</strong></h4>\n<h4>Histograms</h4>\n<p>We all have encountered Histograms before! Haven\u2019t we? Histograms are a fundamental tool that groups values into fixed subsets and presents them graphically. The shape of histograms provides valuable clues about the distribution of values, helping analysts identify patterns such as normal distributions, skewness, or multimodal tendencies.</p>\n<h4>Density plots</h4>\n<p>Density plots offer a smoother alternative to histograms, serving a similar purpose but without the concept of bins. These plots provide a continuous estimation of the probability density function of the variable.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/339/1*JnF9c_1egaHIF7s-FwzfQw.png\"><figcaption>Density Plot</figcaption></figure><h4>Box plots</h4>\n<p>Box plots are another powerful tool for visualizing numeric data distribution. They are particularly useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and for identifying potential outliers. It shows an interquartile distribution spread whose length is determined by the 25th and 75th percentile, i.e. the 1st and 3rd quartile.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/510/1*u7YivORY9ssSsO-chvGF1w.png\"></figure><p>The components of the box plot are the box and the whiskers, the whiskers on the two sides extend to the highest and lowest observations, and represent the outliers, and the vertical line inside the box marks the median. Box plots assist in determining the extent of data dispersion, assessing the symmetry of the data, and evaluating the effectiveness of data grouping.</p>\n<h4>Violin plots</h4>\n<p>Violin plots and box plots share multiple similarities. Specifically, violin plots can be said to combine features of both box plots and density\u00a0plots.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/510/1*WssNoENl8kCKTSAytyKp7Q.png\"></figure><p>While box plots typically display the statistical properties of the data, violin plots depict the complete distribution of the data and are particularly useful for multimodal data or data with multiple\u00a0peaks.</p>\n<p>Having said that, we move to visualisation devices for categorical and binary features.</p>\n<h4>For Categorical and Binary Features:</h4>\n<h4>Frequency tables</h4>\n<p>The frequency table provides the number of occurrences for each unique element in a list, showing their counts or frequencies. It is commonly utilised to assess class imbalance, determining whether all unique elements are evenly distributed in the data or how skewed the data is. Imbalanced data poses specific challenges in machine learning models that can lead to inaccurate predictions, making frequency analysis an essential and fundamental step.</p>\n<h4>Bar plots</h4>\n<p>The bar plot is utilised to illustrate the same information as the frequency table but in the form of a more effective visual representation, which is a graph. It\u2019s easy to confuse bar plots with histograms, so here are a few distinctions between the\u00a0two:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Histograms depict numerical variables, while bar plots depict categorical features.</li>\n<li>In a histogram, the x-axis values are strictly numerical, whereas bar plots provide the flexibility of not encoding the categories to IDs, allowing for direct visualization.</li>\n<li>The x-axis of a histogram is fixed and values cannot be changed, whereas there is some degree of flexibility regarding the bars in bar\u00a0plots.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having learned about techniques for representing individual variables visually, we now progress to visualisation for multiple features, which enables us to depict the connections between two or more distinct variables simultaneously. Like univariate visualisations, specific visualisation formats cater to different variable\u00a0types.</p>\n<h4>4.2 Multiple Feature Visualisation (Multivariate Visualisation)</h4>\n<p>Multivariate visualisation techniques allow for the exploration of relationships between two or more distinct variables. These methods are crucial for uncovering complex patterns and interactions within datasets. We look at quantitative vs quantitative feature visualisations, and quantitative vs categorical feature visualisations.</p>\n<h4>For Quantitative vs Quantitative Variables:</h4>\n<h4>Correlation matrix</h4>\n<p>The correlation matrix is a helpful tool for visualising the relationships between numerical variables in our dataset. This visualisation is particularly valuable for machine learning algorithms that struggle with handling correlated variables. The output is presented as a matrix or table, containing numbers typically within the range of 0 to 1, or another specified range such as for frequency. In addition, colours can be applied to represent different value ranges, enhancing the visual representation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/491/1*Oe9wUm6oiP1gxFRfkQ3H_w.png\"></figure><p>The correlation matrix assists in identifying relationships between different variables, revealing dependencies among variables, and discerning patterns to aid in future predictions. It is instrumental in summarising data and reaching well-founded conclusions.</p>\n<h4>Scatter plots</h4>\n<p>Scatter plots display the values of two variables in a two-dimensional (2-D) space and can also be utilised in three-dimensional (3-D) space. The numerical values of two variables are represented as the x and y coordinates and then graphed in a 2-D or 3-D space. This technique aids in recognizing data patterns, proximity of different data points, and density of occurrence for two or more variables. Their primary function is to detect outliers and gaps in the data, which could potentially impact the model\u2019s performance.</p>\n<h4>Scatter plot\u00a0matrix</h4>\n<p>The scatter plot matrix consists of multiple scatter plots, displaying the relationships between different sets of variables. It is uncommon to use this type of matrix, and interpreting it can be somewhat challenging.</p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s have a look towards quantitative vs categorical feature representation.</p>\n<h4>For Quantitative vs Categorical Features:</h4>\n<h4>Categorical scatter\u00a0plots</h4>\n<p>Categorical scatter plots are similar to regular scatter plots but with points colour-coded or shaped differently based on categories. This allows for the visualization of how the relationship between two quantitative variables might differ across different categories. In this case, the points on the graph belong to different categories, and colour coding or some similar mechanism is used to represent the points based on their categories.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/479/1*JzIy7cVw122haqUAezZhcg.png\"></figure><h4>Categorical box\u00a0plots</h4>\n<p>Categorical box plots show distribution discrepancies between different categories for a quantitative variable. By displaying box plots for each category side by side, analysts can quickly compare distributions, identify outliers, and spot trends or differences across categories.</p>\n<p>The toolkit of visualisation techniques provides a thorough set of tools for analysing data, enabling in-depth exploration and comprehension of datasets. Through the integration of these approaches, analysts can obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of individual variables as well as the intricate relationships among multiple features, ultimately laying the foundation for more well-informed decision-making in machine learning endeavours.</p>\n<h3>5.

The Significance of Data Analysis in Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<p>Data analysis is an essential step in the machine learning process. It involves thoroughly examining datasets to gain valuable insights that inform modelling decisions and help avoid potential pitfalls. This process is critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of machine learning models. Raw data might introduce some errors and inaccuracies in the model, which can be a big risk in the long term. To avoid such scenarios data analysis and pre-processing come into the picture. We now look at the types of data analysis.</p>\n<h3>2. Types of Data\u00a0Analysis</h3>\n<h4>2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis\u00a0(EDA)</h4>\n<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the cornerstone of any machine learning project, serving as the critical first step in understanding and preparing your data. This process primarily utilizes the pandas library in Python, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.</p>\n<p>Exploratory data analysis broadly involves the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extracting various features from the dataset based on the use case and filtering out the relevant and irrelevant information in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>Identifying the number of occurrences of certain elements in columns to help understand the dominant categories of our\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>Understanding key characteristics, patterns, and relationships between different variables to uncover correlations between variables.</li>\n<li>Cleaning the data by removing the irrelevant information and imputing the data to not have any gaps, to make it ready for\u00a0use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main objectives of EDA\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaining a good understanding of the data\u2019s nature and structure, and some valuable insights into the distribution and range of typical variables.</li>\n<li>Cleaning the data by filling empty cells, dropping irrelevant columns, and obtaining statistical values.</li>\n<li>Performing a quality check, data integrity and consistency before any sort of modelling is performed on\u00a0it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This step of exploratory data analysis provides a solid foundation for model development by ensuring that you\u2019re working with clean, relevant, and well-understood data and setting up the stage for successful model development.</p>\n<h4>2.2 Visual Data\u00a0Analysis</h4>\n<p>Visual Data Analysis is a powerful complement to EDA, offering intuitive and accessible ways to understand complex datasets.
